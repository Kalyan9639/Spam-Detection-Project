# Spam-Detection-Project
### Introduction:
This is the full project of Spam Detection Model where i used 3 different datasets to train the model. The model that i used there is Logistic Regression. You can see the code of the model training [here](https://github.com/Kalyan9639/NLP/blob/main/Spam%20Detection%20Model%20trained%203%20different%20data.ipynb)

### Contents/Description of the files:
- The 'spam_detec_model' is the ML model that i downloaded after training on 3 different datasets.
- The 'spam_detec_w2v' is the Word2Vec model which is trained on the corpus of those 3 datasets.
- The 'spam_detection_app.py' is the file where the code for the web application is present.

### About the application:
I used the Python's streamlit module to create this web application. The prediction and data preprocessing is done with the help of the other 2 files present. This app contains a text area, where user can enter theirs title/message and can check whether the text is likely 'SPAM' or 'NOT SPAM'. There are also some example sentences that user can try on.

## Note:
This is just a simple project of using the ML model in a web app. It's not an extension and doesn't support the feature of file uploading or file parsing.
